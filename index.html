            <p>The chicken is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and
                the Ceylon junglefowl that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult
                male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel.</p>

            <h3>Paneer</h3>
            <p>Paneer, also known as ponir or Indian cottage cheese, is a fresh acid-set cheese common in the Indian
                subcontinent made from cow or buffalo milk. It is a non-aged, non-melting soft cheese made by curdling

            <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough
                topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high
                temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.</p>
